# clr.core.cli

An implementation of the Clojure CLI tool and deps.edn tooling for ClojureCLR.

For ClojureCLR on .NET 6 and later.

## Releases

The current release is 0.1.0-alpha6.


## Installation

Prerequisite:  ClojureCLR must be installed as a tool.  See [Getting started (ClojureCLR)](https://github.com/clojure/clojure-clr/wiki/Getting-started).

`cljr` is also installed as a tool.
To install as a global tool:

```
dotnet tool install --global Clojure.Cljr --version 0.1.0-alpha6
```

To install as a local tool:

```
dotnet new tool-manifest # if you are setting up this repo
dotnet tool install --local Clojure.Cljr --version 0.1.0-alpha6
```

For other installation approaches, check out the [Clojure.Cljr Nuget page](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Clojure.Cljr/).

## Running `cljr`

Once installed, you should ube able to invoke (globally or locally) via `cljr`.

## An introduction to deps.edn and the CLI

You can start by reading these references:

- [Clojure CLI Reference](https://clojure.org/reference/clojure_cli)
    - Ignore the nstallation and usage sections; we'll cover this below.
- [deps.edn Reference](https://clojure.org/reference/deps_edn)



## Functionality

A significant portion of the functionality of the JVM version is available.
Some parts await development.  Some likly will never be implemented.

There are two ways to invoke the JVM tool: as 'clj' and as 'clojure'.  
As the docs state:  "In general, you can treat these interchangeably but `clj` includes `rlwrap` for extended keyboard editing, particularly useful with the REPL. 
This reference uses `clj` for REPL examples and `clojure` for non-REPL examples."

`cljr` does not have this distinction (for now).  There is just `cljr`.

The status of the primary commands and the command line options is detailed below.  
In general terms, tools and deps prep are not supported yet.  Anything related to Maven or JVM is not supported.
Most other things are ready for testing.

## deps.edn features

Most of the features of `deps.edn` files are supported.

-- We support git lib and local directory dependencies only.  We do not support maven dependencie or local jars.  (Though we should have a discussion about the latter.)
-- We are still thinking about how nuget might come into play.  It's complicated.
-- We do not yet have support for tool publishing and preparation steps.  See below.

Generally, one puts a `deps.edn` file in the root directory of your code.  However, for projects that support multiple Clojure ports (JVM, CLR, Clojurescript), this will not always work.  
For example, the JVM version may want to use Maven repos for dependencies, which the CLR version does not support.

However, we cannot just read-conditionalization the `deps.edn` file because read-conditionalization is not supported in EDN files.
The workaround is that `cljr` will look for a file named `deps-clr.edn` first, then look for `deps.edn`.  This provides an override that `cljr` can see and the JVM tools will ignore.


## Running tests

If you would like to run tests of your project from the command line, you can take advantage of a port of [cognitect-labs/test-runner](https://github.com/cognitect-labs/test-runner) available at [dmiller/test-runner](https://github.com/dmiller/test-runner).
(If you want to look at the code, look in branch `clr-port`.)

Here is a sample `deps.edn` file set up to use this port of `test-runner`:

```Clojure
{:paths ["src/main/clojure"]
 :deps
 {io.github.clojure/clr.data.generators {:git/tag "v1.1.0" :git/sha "d25d292"}}

 :aliases
 {:test
  {:extra-paths ["src/test/clojure"]
   :extra-deps {io.github.dmiller/test-runner {:git/tag "v0.5.1clr" :git/sha "814e06f"}}
   :exec-fn cognitect.test-runner.api/test
   :exec-args {:dirs ["src/test/clojure"]}}}}
```

You would invoke test running via

```Clojure
cljr -X:test
```

## Things that need work

This is an alpha release.  Have at it.

### Tools and prepping
We need some design thinking around tools and prepping.  Most of the library support on the JVM side are very specific to the JVM world:  Maven, jars, Java-ish things. 

What is needed to support robust program development and installation in the CLR world?

## Clojure versioning

One thing supported on the JVM side is the ability to specify the version of Clojure(JVM) that you want to run under.  This is fairly easily accommodated.  Clojure(JVM) is available as a Maven artifact.  Specify the desired version of Clojure in your application's :deps.   That version will get downloaded and added to the classpath.  And off you go.

We are in a different world entirely on the CLR side.  We don't have a seamless way of incorporating general assemblies into program loading.  At present, ClojureCLR is usually installed as a dotnet tool.

How can we provide ClojureCLR runtime versioning?

##  Nuget

How can we incorporate Nuget packages into the mix.   I can write a Nuget provider that pulls down and caches a Nuget package.  (I found an open-source library that does this; it's pretty easy to adapt to our needs.)  The problem is the variety of things that Nuget package might contain and how it can be used.  It could be a collection of assemblies.  It could be the kind of packaging I've been doing for ClojureCLR libraries: an assembly containing Clojure source files as embedded resources.  (In some ways, I regret that choice.)  A Nuget package could contain Clojure source files in a library folder.  

What design will work for us?
